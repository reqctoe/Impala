There are quite a few things that make a Rush Hour game harder or easier.

More cars in total does not necessarily mean that it is a harder game. An example of this is game 2 and game 3. Both are 6x6, game 2 has 12  cars and 1 trucks, and game 4 has 6 cars and 3 trucks. However, game 2 can be solved in 15 moves, while game 3 needs 33 moves. 

More trucks does make a game harder, as they are harder to move and get around.

What also seems to affect the difficulty is the ratio between horizontal and vertical cars. A higher ratio between these means that there are more opportunities for cars to cross eachother or get in eachothers way, which makes solving the game harder.

For some games, a really specific sequence is needed as part of the solution. This makes them harder.
